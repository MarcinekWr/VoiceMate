Open on GitHub Open on GitHub Introduction Introduction LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models LLMs. LangChain simpliﬁes every stage of the LLM application lifecycle Development Build your applications using LangChains open-source components and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with ﬁrst-class streaming and human-in-the- loop support. Productionization Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with conﬁdence. Deployment Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Platform. LangChain implements a standard interface for large language models and related technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores, and integrates with hundreds of providers. See the integrations page for more.

Select chat model NOTE These docs focus on the Python LangChain library. Head here for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library. Architecture The LangChain framework consists of multiple open-source libraries. Read more in the Architecture page. langchain-core  Base abstractions for chat models and other components. Integration packages e.g. langchain-openai , langchain-anthropic , etc Important integrations have been split into lightweight packages that are co-maintained by the LangChain team and the integration developers. langchain  Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an applications cognitive architecture. langchain-community  Third-party integrations that are community maintained. langgraph  Orchestration framework for combining LangChain components into production-ready applications with persistence, streaming, and other key features.
